# Introduction

**Sustainable Software Engineering** is an emerging discipline at the intersection of climate science, software practices and architecture, electricity markets, hardware and data centre design. 

The **Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering** are a core set of competencies needed to define, build and run sustainable software applications. 

These eight principles form a shared understanding of what it means to be a Sustainable Software Engineer independent of:

*   Application domain.
*   Industry.
*   Organization size or type.
*   Cloud vendor or self-hosted.
*   Programming language or framework.

Through the synthesis of this knowledge, a Sustainable Software Engineer (SSE) can make decisions which have a **meaningful impact** on the carbon pollution of their applications.

## Who should read this?

Anyone building, deploying or managing applications.

## Summary

1. [Carbon](principles/carbon/): Build applications that are carbon efficient.
2. [Electricity](principles/electricity/): Build applications that are energy efficient.
3. [Carbon Intensity](principles/carbon-intensity/): Consume electricity with the lowest carbon intensity.
4. [Embodied Carbon](principles/embodied-carbon/): Build applications that run on older hardware.
5. [Energy Proportionality](principles/energy-proportionality/): Run servers at a high rate of utilization.
6. [Networking](principles/networking/): Reduce the amount of data and distance it must travel across the network.
7. [Demand Shaping](principles/demand-shaping/): Instead of shaping supply to meet demand, try shaping demand to match supply.
8. [Measurement & Optimization](principles/measurement/): Focus on end-to-end optimizations that increase the overall carbon efficiency.

## Applying the principals

Here are a few examples of applying the principals of sustainable software engineering to some common application architectures:

* [Web-Queue-Worker](principles/applied/web-queue-worker/)
* [N-tier](principles/applied/n-tier/)
* [Microservices](principles/applied/microservices/) 
* Event-driven architecture
* Big data
* Big Compute
 
Here are a few examples of applying the principals of sustainable software engineering to some common infrastructure patterns:
 
* Virtualized servers
* IAAS
* PAAS
* Databases
