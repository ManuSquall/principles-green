title: Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering
---
# Introduction

**Sustainable Software Engineering** is a new emerging discipline at the intersection of climate science, software practices and architecture, electricity markets, hardware and data centre design. 

The **Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering** are a core set of competencies needed to define, build and run sustainable software applications. 

These eight principles form a shared understanding of what it means to be a Sustainable Software Engineer independent of:

*   Application domain.
*   Industry.
*   Organization size or type.
*   Cloud vendor or self-hosted.
*   Programming language or framework.

Through the synthesis of this knowledge, a Sustainable Software Engineer (SSE) can make decisions which have a **meaningful impact** on the carbon emissions of applications.

## Who should read this?

Anyone building, deploying or managing applications.

## Summary

1. [Carbon](principles/carbon/): Build applications that are carbon efficient.
2. [Electricity](principles/electricity/): Build applications that are energy efficient.
3. [Carbon Intensity](principles/carbon-intensity/): Consume electricity with the lowest carbon intensity.
4. [Embodied Carbon](principles/embodied-carbon/): Even if you are not consuming electricity, you have still emitted carbon and must account for it.
5. [Energy Proportionality](principles/energy-proportionality/): Run servers at a high rate of utilization.
6. [Networking](principles/networking/): Reduce the amount of data and distance it must travel across the network.
7. [Demand Shifting](principles/demand-shifting/): Be flexible regarding when and where you run workloads to take advantage of low carbon intensity electricity.
8. [Measurement & Optimization](principles/measurement/): Focus on end-to-end optimizations that increase the overall carbon efficiency.
